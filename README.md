# Partisan
An analysis of the partisan behavior for the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate
## Outline
Started with data from each individual vote that took place in the House of Representatives or the Senate, and then summarize data into the CSV files with the use of a scraper. 
Scraper is available in the Data Crawler folder. 
Used Matplotlib to draw preliminary line graphs.
